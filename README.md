# GPGPU

Small library for running arbitrary calculations on the GPU, using JavaScript or WebAssembly.

## Demos

Run ```node server``` and go to ```localhost:1337``` to see some basic demos with performance comparison vs javascript.

*Note: Currently, when using the WebAssembly version, you must currently have a canvas element on the page (can be hidden with CSS) with id ```theCanvas```. In the future this hopefully shouldn't be required.*

## Documentation to follow soonâ„¢

To edit/compile the C++ demo, first run ```node runner.js``` to watch for file changes and automatically compile.
